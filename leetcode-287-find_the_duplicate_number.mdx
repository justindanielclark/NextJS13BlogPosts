## The Problem:
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

#### Example 1:
- Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
- Output: 2
#### Example 2:
- Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
- Output: 3
#### Constraints:
- 1 \<= n \<= 10^5
- nums.length == n + 1
- 1 \<= nums[i] \<= n
- All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
 
#### Follow up:
- How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
- Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

## The Solution:

Lets go over all the solutions we cant do that I can think of:
- Use a set to store numbers as we see them. If the set ever has the number, return that number
- Use a hashmap to store number counts
- Use an empty array at size n and treat it semi-like an array/hashmap
- Sort the array and put a pointer at 0 and 1 and increment by 1 checking if they are ever equal

All of those are great solutions. Instead, given the constraint, we need to do a tortoise and hare check, where you have a slow and fast pointer moving in a loop. If they ever point at the same value, return the value. Array is never modified, so we hit that constraint.

This is fairly slow, but it meets all the requirements.

```ts
function findDuplicate(nums: number[]): number {
  let turtle = 0;
  let hare = 1;
  while (nums[turtle] !== nums[hare]) {
    turtle = turtle + 1;
    hare = hare + 2;
    if (turtle == hare) {
      hare++;
    }

    if (turtle >= nums.length) {
      turtle = turtle - nums.length;
    }
    if (hare >= nums.length) {
      hare = hare - nums.length;
    }
  }
  return nums[turtle];
}
```
