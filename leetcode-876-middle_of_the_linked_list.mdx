## The Problem:

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Examples

#### Example 1:
<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justindanielclark/NextJS13BlogPosts/main/images/876LinkedListImg1.jpg" alt="LinkedListImg1" />
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

#### Example 2:
<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justindanielclark/NextJS13BlogPosts/main/images/876LinkedListImg2.jpg" alt="LinkedListImg2" />
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 
## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
- 1 \<= Node.val \<= 100

Not a lot to say about this one. I had a runner determine the length of the list. Then iterated to find the middle point that the question asked for.

Alternative way is to use O(n) space to create an array and then just check its indexing for the specified point, but I have a feeling that would be slower.

```ts
class ListNode {
  val: number;
  next: ListNode | null;
  constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
    this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
    this.next = next === undefined ? null : next;
  }
}
function middleNode(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
  if(head === null) return null;

  let count = 1;
  let curr = head;
  while(curr.next){
    count++;
    curr = curr.next;
  }
  const isEven = count % 2 === 0;
  let countTo = isEven ? (count / 2) + 1 : Math.ceil(count/2);

  count = 1;
  curr = head;
  while(count !== countTo){
    count++;
    curr = curr.next
  }
  return curr;
}
```

Highest preforming approach was clever in that it just had the middle half as fast as the end pointers:

```ts
function middleNode(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    let middle: ListNode = head;
    let end: ListNode = head;
    while(end != null && end.next !== null) {
        middle = middle.next;
        end = end.next.next;
    }
    return middle;
};
```
