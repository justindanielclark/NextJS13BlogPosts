## The Problem:
You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.

## Examples
#### Example 1:
- Input:  order = "cba", s = "abcd" 
- Output:  "cbad" 
- Explanation: "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".
- Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.
#### Example 2:
- Input:  order = "bcafg", s = "abcd" 
- Output:  "bcad" 
- Explanation: The characters "b", "c", and "a" from order dictate the order for the characters in s. The character "d" in s does not appear in order, so its position is flexible.
#### Constraints:
- 1 \<= order.length \<= 26
- 1 \<= s.length \<= 200
- order and s consist of lowercase English letters.
- All the characters of order are unique.

## The Solution:

```ts
function customSortString(order: string, s: string): string {
  const charMap = new Map<string, number>();
  for (let i = 0; i < order.length; i++) {
    charMap.set(order[i], i);
  }
  return s
    .split("")
    .sort((a, b) => {
      const [aVal, bVal] = [getCharVal(a), getCharVal(b)];
      if (aVal === -1 && bVal === -1) {
        return 0;
      }
      if (aVal === -1) {
        return -1;
      }
      if (bVal === -1) {
        return 1;
      }
      return aVal - bVal;
    })
    .join("");

  function getCharVal(char: string): number {
    if (charMap.has(char)) return charMap.get(char);
    return -1;
  }
}
```
