## The Problem:
A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

#### Example 1:
- Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
- Output: true
- Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
#### Example 2:
- Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
- Output: false
- Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
#### Constraints:
- 2 \<= stones.length \<= 2000
- 0 \<= stones[i] \<= 2^31 - 1
- stones[0] == 0
- stones is sorted in a strictly increasing order.

## The Solution:

This reminds me a lot of a problem I had while learning which tasked me with finding the fastest possible route a knight could take from position a to position b. The solution involved tracking all the possible places the knight could go, then all the places they could go from there, and all the places they could go from there, until they hit the target or they ran out of novel positions to visit. This is easy to track, given a 'novel' position is any particular stone at a particular speed. I came up with the following sollution, which hit middle of the pack in performance and memory:
```ts
function canCross(stones: number[]): boolean {
  if (stones[0] !== 0 || stones[1] !== 1) return false;
  if (stones[0] == 0 && stones[1] == 1 && stones.length == 2) return true;

  class Position {
    public stone: number;
    public speed: number;
    public constructor(stone: number, speed: number) {
      this.stone = stone;
      this.speed = speed;
    }
    public getPossibleNextPositions(): Array<[number, number]> {
      const returnable: Array<[number, number]> = [];
      if (this.speed - 1 > 0) {
        returnable.push([this.stone + this.speed - 1, this.speed - 1]);
      }
      returnable.push([this.stone + this.speed, this.speed]);
      returnable.push([this.stone + this.speed + 1, this.speed + 1]);
      return returnable;
    }
    public generateStringRepresentation(): string {
      return `${this.stone}_${this.speed}`;
    }
    public static generateStringRepresentation(position: number, speed: number): string {
      return `${position}_${speed}`;
    }
  }
  const validStones = new Set<number>(stones);
  const priorMoves = new Set<string>();
  const end = stones[stones.length - 1];
  const startingPosition = new Position(1, 1);
  let currentTurn: Position[] = [startingPosition];
  let nextTurn: Position[] = [];
  priorMoves.add(startingPosition.generateStringRepresentation());
  let found = false;
  while (currentTurn.length > 0 && !found) {
    for (let i = 0; i < currentTurn.length; i++) {
      currentTurn[i].getPossibleNextPositions().forEach(([position, speed]) => {
        if (validStones.has(position) && !priorMoves.has(Position.generateStringRepresentation(position, speed))) {
          if (position === end) {
            found = true;
          }
          const newPos = new Position(position, speed);
          nextTurn.push(newPos);
          priorMoves.add(newPos.generateStringRepresentation());
        }
      });
    }
    currentTurn = nextTurn;
    nextTurn = [];
  }
  return found;
}
```

Strings are hashable for quick lookups, so using 'stringifying' the position as its stone and speed into a Set to store 'novel' positions to prevent further iterative calls down duplicate requests. Other than that, most of this is fairly self explanatory.

Start of the code is just for handling edge cases:
```ts
if (stones[0] !== 0 || stones[1] !== 1) return false;
if (stones[0] == 0 && stones[1] == 1 && stones.length == 2) return true;
```

Then we define a data class which will store a stones position and the speed we were at given the position. It also has methods to generate it's string representation for the set hashing
```ts
class Position {
  public stone: number;
  public speed: number;
  public constructor(stone: number, speed: number) {
    this.stone = stone;
    this.speed = speed;
  }
  public getPossibleNextPositions(): Array<[number, number]> {
    const returnable: Array<[number, number]> = [];
    if (this.speed - 1 > 0) {
      returnable.push([this.stone + this.speed - 1, this.speed - 1]);
    }
    returnable.push([this.stone + this.speed, this.speed]);
    returnable.push([this.stone + this.speed + 1, this.speed + 1]);
    return returnable;
  }
  public generateStringRepresentation(): string {
    return `${this.stone}_${this.speed}`;
  }
  public static generateStringRepresentation(position: number, speed: number): string {
    return `${position}_${speed}`;
  }
}
```

Then we create a set of valid stones and all prior moves and record what the last possible position is.

We declare an array called currentTurn which will always track which positions we need to look through and another arry called nextTurn, which will store all possible moves on the turn after this current one.

Then, we iterate through nextTurn checking each position to see what possible positions we could move to from the current position, and we store those in nextTurn. If we ever see our end, we return true, otherwise we just keep iterating. After iterating through all current moves, nextMoves becomes current and we resent nextMoves.

If we ever run out of current moves, we simply return false.

That section looks like:
```ts
const validStones = new Set<number>(stones);
const priorMoves = new Set<string>();
const end = stones[stones.length - 1];
const startingPosition = new Position(1, 1);
let currentTurn: Position[] = [startingPosition];
let nextTurn: Position[] = [];
priorMoves.add(startingPosition.generateStringRepresentation());
let found = false;
while (currentTurn.length > 0 && !found) {
  for (let i = 0; i < currentTurn.length; i++) {
    currentTurn[i].getPossibleNextPositions().forEach(([position, speed]) => {
      if (validStones.has(position) && !priorMoves.has(Position.generateStringRepresentation(position, speed))) {
        if (position === end) {
          found = true;
        }
        const newPos = new Position(position, speed);
        nextTurn.push(newPos);
        priorMoves.add(newPos.generateStringRepresentation());
      }
    });
  }
  currentTurn = nextTurn;
  nextTurn = [];
}
return found;
```

The full solution:
```ts
function canCross(stones: number[]): boolean {
  if (stones[0] !== 0 || stones[1] !== 1) return false;
  if (stones[0] == 0 && stones[1] == 1 && stones.length == 2) return true;

  class Position {
    public stone: number;
    public speed: number;
    public constructor(stone: number, speed: number) {
      this.stone = stone;
      this.speed = speed;
    }
    public getPossibleNextPositions(): Array<[number, number]> {
      const returnable: Array<[number, number]> = [];
      if (this.speed - 1 > 0) {
        returnable.push([this.stone + this.speed - 1, this.speed - 1]);
      }
      returnable.push([this.stone + this.speed, this.speed]);
      returnable.push([this.stone + this.speed + 1, this.speed + 1]);
      return returnable;
    }
    public generateStringRepresentation(): string {
      return `${this.stone}_${this.speed}`;
    }
    public static generateStringRepresentation(position: number, speed: number): string {
      return `${position}_${speed}`;
    }
  }
  const validStones = new Set<number>(stones);
  const priorMoves = new Set<string>();
  const end = stones[stones.length - 1];
  const startingPosition = new Position(1, 1);
  let currentTurn: Position[] = [startingPosition];
  let nextTurn: Position[] = [];
  priorMoves.add(startingPosition.generateStringRepresentation());
  let found = false;
  while (currentTurn.length > 0 && !found) {
    for (let i = 0; i < currentTurn.length; i++) {
      currentTurn[i].getPossibleNextPositions().forEach(([position, speed]) => {
        if (validStones.has(position) && !priorMoves.has(Position.generateStringRepresentation(position, speed))) {
          if (position === end) {
            found = true;
          }
          const newPos = new Position(position, speed);
          nextTurn.push(newPos);
          priorMoves.add(newPos.generateStringRepresentation());
        }
      });
    }
    currentTurn = nextTurn;
    nextTurn = [];
  }
  return found;
}
```

Fun problem.
