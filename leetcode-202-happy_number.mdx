## The Problem:
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.

Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.

Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

#### Example 1:
- Input: n = 19
- Output: true
#### Explanation:
- 12 + 92 = 82
- 82 + 22 = 68
- 62 + 82 = 100
- 12 + 02 + 02 = 1
#### Example 2:
- Input: n = 2
- Output: false
#### Constraints:
- 1 \<= n \<= 2^31 - 1

## The Solution:

Pen and paper'd this one. Doesn't matter how large of a number you start with, if you square the digits and add them together, you will eventually reduce down to a 1-3 digit number. The oddity is, un-happy numbers get caught in a loop. Easy enough, start a cycle, track the numbers with a Set, if you ever see them, return false, otherwise, keep looking for a set of digits that adds to 1.

```ts
function isHappy(n: number): boolean {
  let num = n;
  let numSet = new Set<number>();
  numSet.add(n);
  while (true) {
    num = num
      .toString()
      .split("")
      .map((number) => Math.pow(parseInt(number), 2))
      .reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr, 0);
    if (num === 1) return true;
    if (numSet.has(num)) return false;
    numSet.add(num);
  }
}
```
Here's another oddity, often, numbers will 'reduce' down to a single digit. Turns out only 7 and 1 result in happy numbers, so another approach:

```ts
function isHappy(n: number): boolean {
  let num = n;
  let numSet = new Set<number>([0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]);
  while (true) {
    num = num
      .toString()
      .split("")
      .map((number) => Math.pow(parseInt(number), 2))
      .reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr, 0);
    if (num === 1) return true;
    if (numSet.has(num)) return false;
  }
}
```

This approach tends to be the fastest. You could also add other numbers that pop up often that result in unhappy numbers like: 37, 64, ... to speed up cycles.
