### Neetcode Set: Two Pointers
### Neetcode Problem \#: 4\/5

## The Problem

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

#### Example 1:
- Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
- Output: 49
#### Explanation: 
- The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
#### Example 2:
- Input: height = [1,1]
- Output: 1
#### Constraints:
- n == height.length
- 2 \<= n \<= 105
- 0 \<= height[i] \<= 104

## The Solution

This problem has a goofy name and problem description. We are given a bunch of heights. We want to compute the maximum area between two heights at two points.

We can calculate area by multiplying the range between the two points by the smaller of the two heights. Essentially, we want to maximize both range and height to maximize area. 

Out of the gate, I thought I had a brilliant solution that turned out to be less than ideal. The idea, in really generic psuedocode would be:
- Figure out what the two biggest heights were
- Calculate what would be possible for a given range supposing those two were the heights
- Start at the maximum possible range
- Record areas moving the range from left to right with a record of what the highest was
- Reduce the range and recalculate what would be the maximum possible values with that range
- Keep doing this until our recorded max is higher than whatever the possible range is given the above limitations

```ts
function maxArea(height: number[]) {
  const largest = [...height].sort((a, b) => b - a);
  let highest_possible = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
  let current_highest = 0;
  let range = height.length - 1;
  while (current_highest < highest_possible) {
    highest_possible = range * largest[1];
    for (let [i, j] = [0, range]; j < height.length; [i++, j++]) {
      let lowest = height[i] < height[j] ? height[i] : height[j];
      if (current_highest < lowest * range) current_highest = lowest * range;
    }
    range--;
  }
  return current_highest;
}
```
This works fast supposing both of your high points are near the edges of the array, but completely falls apart if you have a massive jump in heights right next to each other, as it ends up checking every range combination. Imagine it running through this array for instance...

```ts
const testArr = [
  1, 1, 1, ... x10000 ..., 1, 1, 1, 1000000000, 1000000000
]
```

Time to hit the drawing board again.

Given we want to maximize both range and height, why not just start with the maximum range, and simply move the pointers toward a place where each pointer was encouraged to increase? The below solutions does just that, and finds the answer all the same in O(n) time. 

Much faster.

```ts
function maxArea(height: number[]) {
  let max = 0;
  let [left, right] = [0, height.length - 1];
  while (left < right) {
    max = Math.max(max, Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left));
    if (Math.min(height[left], height[right]) === height[left]) {
      left++;
      continue;
    }
    right--;
  }
  return max;
}
```
