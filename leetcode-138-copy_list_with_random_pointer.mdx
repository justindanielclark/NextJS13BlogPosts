## The Problem:

A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --\> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --\> y.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of \[val, random_index\] where:

- val: an integer representing Node.val
- random_index: the index of the node \(range from 0 to n-1\) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

#### Example 1:
<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justindanielclark/NextJS13BlogPosts/main/images/deepcopylinklistwithrandompointers1.png" alt="example_1" />
- Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
- Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

#### Example 2:
<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justindanielclark/NextJS13BlogPosts/main/images/deepcopylinklistwithrandompointers2.png" alt="example_2" />
- Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
- Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]

#### Example 3:
<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justindanielclark/NextJS13BlogPosts/main/images/deepcopylinklistwithrandompointers3.png" alt="example_3" />
- Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
- Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

```ts
/*Definition for Node.*/
class Node {
    val: number
    next: Node | null
    random: Node | null
    constructor(val?: number, next?: Node, random?: Node) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
        this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
        this.random = (random===undefined ? null : random)
    }
}
```

## The Solution

First thing that came to mind ended up being what I stuck with. Create a map where the key is the node and the value is the new node. Do this in one pass. Do a second pass where we now link everything up. Easy Peasy.

```ts
function copyRandomList(head: Node | null): Node | null {
  if (head == null) return null;
  const nodeMap = new Map<Node, Node>();
  //First Pass To Build Out The Map
  let curr = head;
  while (curr) {
    nodeMap.set(curr, new Node(curr.val));
    curr = curr.next;
  }
  //Second Pass To Link Everything Up
  curr = head;
  while(curr){
    const next = nodeMap.get(curr.next);
    if(next){
      nodeMap.get(curr).next = next;
    }
    nodeMap.get(curr).random = nodeMap.get(curr.random);
    curr = curr.next;
  }
  return nodeMap.get(head)
}
```

Hit 70% on performance and 100% on memory usage, which I know is variable, but this solution couldn't be all bad.
