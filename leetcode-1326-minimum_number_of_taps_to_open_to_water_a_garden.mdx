## The Problem
There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point 0 and ends at the point n. (i.e The length of the garden is n).

There are n + 1 taps located at points [0, 1, ..., n] in the garden.

Given an integer n and an integer array ranges of length n + 1 where ranges[i] (0-indexed) means the i-th tap can water the area [i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]] if it was open.

Return the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return -1.

#### Example 1:
- Input: n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]
- Output: 1
##### Explanation:
<CustomImage src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justindanielclark/NextJS13BlogPosts/main/images/minimumNumberOfTabsToOpen.png" alt="minimumNumberOfTabsToOpen" />
- The tap at point 0 can cover the interval [-3,3]
- The tap at point 1 can cover the interval [-3,5]
- The tap at point 2 can cover the interval [1,3]
- The tap at point 3 can cover the interval [2,4]
- The tap at point 4 can cover the interval [4,4]
- The tap at point 5 can cover the interval [5,5]
- Opening Only the second tap will water the whole garden [0,5]

#### Example 2:
- Input: n = 3, ranges = [0,0,0,0]
- Output: -1
##### Explanation: 
- Even if you activate all the four taps you cannot water the whole garden.

#### Constraints:
- 1 \<= n \<= 104
- ranges.length == n + 1
- 0 \<= ranges[i] \<= 100

## The Solution:

### My first approach
This was something I had to actually at least get a working copy out of before I knew it was incorrect.

The approach was to track which points required which taps to be open in order to be covered. I figured that if I knew which idx's in the garden had only 1 possible tap that worked for them, these taps were by default part of the minimum requirements. If any had 0 possible, then we could exit early because nothing could water certain points.

This resulted in the below cursory implementation:

```ts
function minTaps(n: number, ranges: number[]): number {
  const rangesArr = ranges.map((range, idx) => [idx - range, idx + range]);
  const gardenMap = new Map<number, Set<number>>(
    Array.from({ length: ranges.length }).map((item, idx) => [idx, new Set<number>()])
  );

  for (let i = 0; i < ranges.length; i++) {
    const idxSet = gardenMap.get(i) as Set<number>;
    for (let j = 0; j < ranges.length; j++) {
      const range = rangesArr[j];
      if (isWithin(i, range[0], range[1])) {
        idxSet.add(j);
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
  function isWithin(num: number, min: number, max: number): boolean {
    return min <= num && num <= max;
  }
}

minTaps(5, [0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1]);

/*

[ [ 0, 0 ], [ -2, 4 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 1, 5 ], [ 0, 8 ], [ 4, 6 ] ]

Map(6) {
  0 => Set(3) { 0, 1, 4 },
  1 => Set(4) { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
  2 => Set(4) { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
  3 => Set(4) { 1, 2, 3, 4 },
  4 => Set(4) { 1, 3, 4, 5 },
  5 => Set(3) { 3, 4, 5 }
}

*/
```

From the get-go you can see a problem. Where do we go from here? It isn't clear, and it appears this implementation is doomed from the start.

### Some realizations
This algorithm would likely want to accomplish a few things:
- It would like to have each tap opened be the one possible from that position which conveyed the greatest value. In this case, value would be the most places watered
- If we ever hit an index that no hose could water, we inherently needed to return early.
- If we knew what the greatest possible power a hose could output, we also could limit the amount of searching done up and down the array for valid hoses

This resulted in the following implementation:

First, we just declare some tracking variables. We additionally use one O(n) pass on the array to figure out what the strongest possible hose is, as we want to look for it on each iteration if we can:
```ts
let numOps = 0;
let searchRange = 0;
let error = false;
let searching = true;
let centerPointer = 0;
ranges.forEach((num) => {
  if (searchRange < num) searchRange = num;
});
//If the strongest hose is 7, we now know from whatever our point is, we can look 7 forward or backward for a hose that can cover ground if we need it to
```

I also need some functions to do some helper work:
```ts
function calculateLeftCenterRight(
  newPosition: number,
  searchRange: number,
  upperLimit: number
): [number, number, number] {
  return [
    newPosition - searchRange < 0 ? 0 : newPosition - searchRange,
    newPosition,
    newPosition + searchRange > upperLimit ? upperLimit : newPosition + searchRange,
  ];
}
function calculateValue(power: number, idx: number, c: number, upperLimit: number): number {
  //It's power cannot reach our node, so it is useless this iteration
  if (power === 0) return 0;
  if (c < idx && c < idx - power) return 0;
  if (idx < c && c > idx + power) return 0;
  //Power Reaches Our Node
  let upper = idx + power;
  if (upper > upperLimit) upper = upperLimit;
  return upper - c;
}
```

#### calculateLeftCenterRight() 
gives me 3 sets of pointers I can work with when sliding up the array. The l variable tracks how far left I can look, c is where I am currently looking, and r is the rightmost. The distance between l -> c and c -> r is purely a reflection of the possible search range based on what the highest possible power of a hose is.

#### calculateValue() 
gives a value score for any given hose index. A hose that waters more spaces is worth more. Some hoses with a high power water spaces that have already been watered, so they are less valuable. Others have low power, but water the spaces we need them to most when advancing. The score reflects that. If a hose cannot water our central space, we have a problem, and that hose is worth nothing.

Now, we just combine all of it with an iterative solution to track where our pointers are, and advance them by the best power gain in a range:

```ts
function minTaps(n: number, ranges: number[]): number {
  let numOps = 0;
  let searchRange = 0;
  let error = false;
  let searching = true;
  let centerPointer = 0;
  ranges.forEach((num) => {
    if (searchRange < num) searchRange = num;
  });
  while (!error && searching) {
    let [l, c, r] = calculateLeftCenterRight(centerPointer, serchRange, n);
    let highestValue = 0; //lowest possible
    let highestIndex = -1; //error if never changed
    let highestIndexPower = -1;
    Array.from({ length: r - l + 1 }).forEach((item, idx) => {
      const value = calculateValue(ranges[idx + l], idx + l, c, n);
      if (value > highestValue) {
        highestValue = value;
        highestIndex = idx + l;
        highestIndexPower = ranges[idx + l];
      }
    });
    if (highestIndex === -1) {
      error = true;
    } else {
      numOps++;
      centerPointer = highestIndex + highestIndexPower;
      if (centerPointer >= n) {
        searching = false;
      }
    }
  }
  if (error) return -1;
  return numOps;
  function calculateLeftCenterRight(
    newPosition: number,
    searchRange: number,
    upperLimit: number
  ): [number, number, number] {
    return [
      newPosition - searchRange < 0 ? 0 : newPosition - searchRange,
      newPosition,
      newPosition + searchRange > upperLimit ? upperLimit : newPosition + searchRange,
    ];
  }
  function calculateValue(power: number, idx: number, c: number, upperLimit: number): number {
    //It's power cannot reach our node, so it is useless this iteration
    if (power === 0) return 0;
    if (c < idx && c < idx - power) return 0;
    if (idx < c && c > idx + power) return 0;
    //Power Reaches Our Node
    let upper = idx + power;
    if (upper > upperLimit) upper = upperLimit;
    return upper - c;
  }
}
```
