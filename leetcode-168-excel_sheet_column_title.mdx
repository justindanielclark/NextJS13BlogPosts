## The Problem:

Given an integer columnNumber, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.

#### For example:
- A -> 1
- B -> 2
- C -> 3
- ...
- Z -> 26
- AA -> 27
- AB -> 28 
#### Example 1:
- Input: columnNumber = 1
- Output: "A"
#### Example 2:
- Input: columnNumber = 28
- Output: "AB"
#### Example 3:
- Input: columnNumber = 701
- Output: "ZY"
##### Constraints:
- 1 \<= columnNumber \<= 231 - 1

## The Solution

First thing I noticed is that counting in 'Excel' is just normal counting but with a different base. In base ten we go from 1->2->3->...->7->8->9->10

After 9, we run out of digits to use, so we increment the total number of 'columns'. Excel counting works the same way but directly with letters. A->B->C->...X->Y->Z->AA

There are 26 letters in the alphabet, so we have a base 26 system. Time to figure out how to convert base systems...

A quick google search lands me at [this site on hex conversion](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html)

In it, they start with the number as provided, and obtain its quotient and its remainder after being divided by the base conversion. Easy enough:
```ts
let quotient = Math.floor(value / 26);
let remainder = value % 26;
```

After doing a round of this, if the quotient is greater than 0, you simply do it again to the quotient, until the quotient is 0 or less than 0. This leads to a recursive or iterative solution.

Note: Z === 26 in the conversion. However, if we divide 26/26, we get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 0. This is an exception case we need to account for.

I came up with the following solution:

```ts
function convertToTitle(columnNumber: number): string {
  const numMap = new Map<number, string>([
    [1, "A"],
    [2, "B"],
    [3, "C"],
    [4, "D"],
    [5, "E"],
    [6, "F"],
    [7, "G"],
    [8, "H"],
    [9, "I"],
    [10, "J"],
    [11, "K"],
    [12, "L"],
    [13, "M"],
    [14, "N"],
    [15, "O"],
    [16, "P"],
    [17, "Q"],
    [18, "R"],
    [19, "S"],
    [20, "T"],
    [21, "U"],
    [22, "V"],
    [23, "W"],
    [24, "X"],
    [25, "Y"],
    [0, "Z"],
  ]);
  const store: string[] = [];
  iterate(store, columnNumber);
  return store.join("");

  function iterate(store: string[], value: number) {
    let quotient = Math.floor(value / 26);
    let remainder = value % 26;
    if (remainder === 0) {
      quotient--;
    }
    store.unshift(numMap.get(remainder));
    if (quotient > 0 && value !== 26) {
      iterate(store, quotient);
    }
    return;
  }
}
```
