Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k, split the linked list into k consecutive linked list parts.

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one. This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later.

Return an array of the k parts.

#### Example 1:
- Input: head = [1,2,3], k = 5
- Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
#### Explanation:
The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.

The last element output[4] is null, but its string representation as a ListNode is [].

#### Example 2:
- Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k = 3
- Output: [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7],[8,9,10]]
#### Explanation:
The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.
 
#### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 1000].
- 0 \<= Node.val \<= 1000
- 1 \<= k \<= 50

## The Solution

#### Lets talk initial observations:
- We have to know the size of the list before we can do anything.
- If we know the size of the list, depending on the value of k, there are two routes:
1. k \> size
2. k \< size

#### Lets start with the easier one: k \> size;
- Declare an answer array of ListNodes | null
- Declare a current list node under consideration variable and set it to the head
- Declare a loop at 0 which increments to k before dying
- As long as we have nodes, add them to the array
- Remove the recently added nodes next pointer so it doesn't reference anything moving forward
- Once we are out of nodes, add null values to the array so the array hits k size
- Return the array

#### Now for the harder one: k \< size 
We will observe that some of the returned heads linked list is larger than the others in the array. This happens when k does not evenly divide into the list size.

Suppose:
```ts
const nodes = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
const k = 3;
const answer = [[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7], [8,9,10]]

const nodes = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
const k = 7;
const answer = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]
```

We can find parts of these answers in doing some math:
```ts
const nodes = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
const k = 3;
const ceil = Math.ceil(nodes.length / k) // 4
const floor = Math.floor(nodes.length/k) // 3
const modolo = 10 % 3                    // 1
const answer = [[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7], [8,9,10]]
```
The answer has arrays that are size (ceil) (modolo) times until they are size (floor).

So, for the next part, we simply need to:
- Declare an answer array of ListNodes
- Declare a current list node under consideration variable and set it to the head
- Find the values for floor, ceil, and modolo (mod)
- Declare a loop at 0 which increments to k before dying
- Intend to decrement mod every time we loop
- If mod is greater than 0, separate out lists that are ceil in size. Otherwise separate out lists that are floor in size.
- Remove the recently added node's tails final pointer's next pointer so it doesn't reference anything moving forward
- Return the array

Finished code is below:
```ts
class ListNode {
  val: number;
  next: ListNode | null;
  constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
    this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
    this.next = next === undefined ? null : next;
  }
}
function splitListToParts(head: ListNode | null, k: number): Array<ListNode | null> {
  const returnArray: Array<ListNode | null> = [];
  let current = head;
  let prev: ListNode;
  let size = 0;
  while (current) {
    size++;
    current = current.next;
  }
  current = head;
  if (k < size) {
    let floor = Math.floor(size / k);
    let ceil = Math.ceil(size / k);
    let mod = size % k;
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      returnArray.push(current);
      if (mod > 0) {
        for (let j = 0; j < ceil; j++) {
          prev = current;
          current = current.next;
        }
        prev.next = null;
        mod--;
      } else {
        for (let k = 0; k < floor; k++) {
          prev = current;
          current = current.next;
        }
        prev.next = null;
      }
    }
  } else {
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      if (current) {
        returnArray.push(current);
        current = current.next;
        returnArray[returnArray.length - 1].next = null;
        continue;
      }
      returnArray.push(null);
    }
  }
  return returnArray;
}
```
