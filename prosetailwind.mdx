## Tailwind and How It Handles Default Styling

Perhaps my favorite feature of Tailwindcss is that right out of the gate with installation it removes all default browser styling. It normalizes all font sizes, margins, paddings, line-heights, kerning, and borders across all html element types. It additionally removes list styling from both ordered and unordered lists, quotes from blockquote and q, and collapses all tables by default.

This normalization is a great starting place for a web developer building even a slightly modified style system, as each browser comes with its own opinions on default styling. Setting everything to 0 makes sure everything is consistent across browser types.

But what happens if you need tailwind to have some default styling for html elements within a context? In my case, for this blog, I have some .mdx files which represent each of these blog posts stored in a site other than where this server is hosted. A library pulls them and transpiles them into basic HTML based on the markdown. If I want to use tailwind out of the box, these posts will be flavorless and bland as they will lack any of the utility classes tailwind is known for.

## Enter &#64tailwindcss/typography

&#64tailwindcss/typography is a plugin maintained by the Tailwind team which allows you to define a context by which the default stripped behavior of tailwind will no longer apply. This allows you to make a container and plug in your flavorless, utility-less html generated by a libary, and a predefined set of styles work on it.

Installation is easy
```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

Then, in tailwind.config.js, add the plugin directly to the plugins array
```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    // ...
  ],
}
```

From here, utilizing these styles is as easy as adding the 'prose' class to a parent context like so:
```jsx
//I am a parent context
<div className="prose">
  //Child -> inherits all parent stylings
  <p>I am some content</p>
  //Child -> inherits all parent stylings
  <p>I am some more content</p>
</div>
```

To modify what the context does on all children, modify the prose class in the parent:
```jsx
//All paragraphs within the div will now have a x-padding of 10rem
<div className="prose prose-p:px-10">
  <p>I am some content with a x-padding of 10</p>
  <p>I am some more content with a x-padding of 10</p>
</div>
```

To modify what the context does on a specific child, simply override it directly if needed in the child affected:
```jsx
//All paragraphs within the div will now have a x-padding of 10rem
<div className="prose prose-p:px-10">
  <p>I am some content</p>
  <p className="px-0">I am some more content but I have no x padding</p>
</div>
```
