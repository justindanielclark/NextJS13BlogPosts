## The Problem:

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, return the minimum integer common to both arrays. If there is no common integer amongst nums1 and nums2, return -1.

Note that an integer is said to be common to nums1 and nums2 if both arrays have at least one occurrence of that integer.

## Example 1:
- Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4]
- Output: 2
- Explanation: The smallest element common to both arrays is 2, so we return 2.
## Example 2:
- Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,6], nums2 = [2,3,4,5]
- Output: 2
- Explanation: There are two common elements in the array 2 and 3 out of which 2 is the smallest, so 2 is returned.
## Constraints:
- 1 \<= nums1.length, nums2.length \<= 105
- 1 \<= nums1[i], nums2[j] \<= 109
- Both nums1 and nums2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

## The Solution

Two ways to tackle this one. I'll go with my first approach which was to create two pointers and increment whichever pointed to the lowest value until they are equal or one overflows for their respective array:

```ts
function getCommon(nums1: number[], nums2: number[]): number {
  let [pointer_1, pointer_2] = [0, 0];
  while (pointer_1 < nums1.length && pointer_2 < nums2.length) {
    if (nums1[pointer_1] === nums2[pointer_2]) return nums1[pointer_1];
    if (nums1[pointer_1] < nums2[pointer_2]) {
      pointer_1++;
    } else {
      pointer_2++;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

Runs decently fast.

Alternative approach is to turn one into a set and then just check the other against it moving up the array.

```ts
function getCommon(nums1: number[], nums2: number[]): number {
  let num1Set = new Set<number>(nums1);
  for (let i = 0; i < nums2.length; i++) {
    if (num1Set.has(nums2[i])) return nums2[i];
  }
  return -1;
}
```
